<anti_patterns>

<avoid name="obsession">
Don't spend so much time watching competitors that you neglect customers. Customer needs matter more than competitor moves.
</avoid>

<avoid name="copying">
Don't copy competitor strategies wholesale. What works for them may not work for you given different strengths, audiences, and resources.
</avoid>

<avoid name="comparison-marketing">
Avoid negative comparison ads unless you're the underdog. Focus on your strengths, not their weaknesses.
</avoid>

<avoid name="feature-parity">
Don't try to match every competitor feature. You'll end up mediocre at everything. Be excellent at what matters most to your audience.
</avoid>
