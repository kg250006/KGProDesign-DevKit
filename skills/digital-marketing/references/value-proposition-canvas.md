<validation_checklist>

<checkpoint name="fit-check">
Does your value map address the most important:
- [ ] Customer jobs? (Not just any jobs, but priority jobs)
- [ ] Customer pains? (Not just minor annoyances, but real blockers)
- [ ] Customer gains? (Not just nice-to-haves, but meaningful outcomes)
</checkpoint>

<checkpoint name="differentiation-check">
Is your value proposition:
- [ ] Specific to your target audience? (Not trying to be everything to everyone)
- [ ] Different from competitors? (Not just "better" but distinctly different)
- [ ] Believable and provable? (Not just claims, but backed by evidence)
</checkpoint>

<checkpoint name="clarity-check">
Can you explain your value proposition:
- [ ] In one sentence?
- [ ] To someone unfamiliar with your industry?
- [ ] In a way that makes people want to learn more?
</checkpoint>

</validation_checklist>

<best_practices>

<practice>Start with the customer profile. Don't design your value map first - understand the customer deeply, then match your offering to their needs.</practice>

<practice>Focus on the most important jobs, pains, and gains. You can't address everything. Prioritize ruthlessly.</practice>

<practice>Test your UVP with real customers. Ask "Does this describe how you think about your problem?" and "Does this make you want to learn more?"</practice>

<practice>Iterate based on feedback. Your first UVP won't be perfect. Refine it based on what resonates and what falls flat.</practice>

<practice>Use customer language. The words customers use to describe their problems are more powerful than marketing jargon.</practice>

</best_practices>
