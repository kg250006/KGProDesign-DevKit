<step_1 name="discovery-assessment">

Understand business model and goals:
- What does the business sell? (product, service, SaaS, course)
- What is the current revenue model?
- What are the primary business goals for next 90 days?
- What marketing has been tried before?
- What is the available budget and resources?

Identify target audience characteristics:
- Who is the ideal customer?
- What problem do they have that you solve?
- Where do they spend time online?

Assess current marketing state:
- Existing website/landing pages?
- Email list size?
- Social media presence?
- Current traffic sources?

</step_1>

<step_2 name="customer-avatar-development">

Use customer-avatar-template.md to create detailed profile:
- Demographics (age, location, income, occupation)
- Psychographics (values, interests, lifestyle)
- Pain points (what frustrates them)
- Goals and desires (what they want to achieve)
- Objections (why they might not buy)
- Where they hang out (online and offline)
- Buying behavior (how they make decisions)

Create 2-3 avatars if multiple distinct segments exist.

</step_2>

<step_3 name="value-proposition-design">

Use value-proposition-canvas.md:

Customer Profile:
- Jobs to be done (what they're trying to accomplish)
- Pains (frustrations and obstacles)
- Gains (outcomes they desire)

Value Map:
- Products and services offered
- Pain relievers (how you remove frustrations)
- Gain creators (how you create positive outcomes)

Craft UVP statement using formula:
"We help [target audience] achieve [desired outcome] by [unique approach] without [common pain]."

</step_3>

<step_4 name="channel-selection">

Evaluate channels based on:
- Where does target audience spend time?
- What resources are available (budget, skills, time)?
- What has worked before?
- What is the competition doing?

Prioritize top 3 channels:
- Primary channel (where to focus 60% of effort)
- Secondary channel (where to expand)
- Testing channel (where to experiment)

Common channel recommendations by business type:
- B2B services: LinkedIn + Email + Content
- B2C products: Instagram + Facebook Ads + Email
- SaaS: Content SEO + Email + Paid Search
- Local business: Google My Business + Facebook + Referrals

</step_4>
