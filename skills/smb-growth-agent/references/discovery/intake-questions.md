<overview>
Business discovery framework for understanding client context before proposing solutions. Use these questions to build a complete picture of the business, constraints, and goals.
</overview>

<business_fundamentals>

<question_set name="company-basics">
Essential context gathering:
- What is your business name and how long have you been operating?
- What products or services do you offer?
- Who is your target customer/client?

- Are you profitable or growth-stage?
</question_set>

<question_set name="business-model">
Understanding how money flows:
- How do you acquire customers (marketing channels, referrals, etc.)?
- What is your pricing model (one-time, subscription, hourly)?
- What is your average transaction value?
- What are your main cost drivers?
- Who are your main competitors?
</question_set>

<question_set name="current-challenges">
Identifying pain points:
- What is the biggest bottleneck in your business right now?
- What manual processes take the most time?
- Where do you lose customers or opportunities?
- What do customers complain about most?
- What keeps you up at night about your business?
</question_set>

<question_set name="goals-and-constraints">
Understanding what success looks like:
- What are your goals for the next 12 months?
- What would success look like for this project?
- What is your budget range for technology solutions?
- What is your timeline for seeing results?
- Who needs to approve decisions?
</question_set>

</business_fundamentals>

<technology_landscape>

<question_set name="current-systems">
Mapping existing technology:
- What software do you currently use (CRM, accounting, etc.)?
- Do you have a website? What platform (WordPress, Shopify, custom)?
- What payment processor do you use?
- Do you use any automation tools (Zapier, etc.)?
- Where is your data stored (spreadsheets, databases, SaaS)?
</question_set>

<question_set name="technical-capability">
Understanding support capacity:
- Do you have in-house technical staff?
- Who maintains your current systems?
- What is your comfort level with new technology?
- Have you worked with developers or agencies before?
- What technology projects have succeeded or failed in the past?
</question_set>

<question_set name="integrations">
Understanding connection requirements:
- What systems need to talk to each other?
- Do you have APIs or export capabilities for your current tools?
- Are there any systems that cannot be changed?
- Do you need mobile access to systems?
- Do you work with any external partners that need system access?
</question_set>

</technology_landscape>

<constraint_mapping>

<question_set name="budget">
Financial constraints:
- What is your budget range for this project?
- Do you prefer one-time cost or ongoing subscription?
- Is there flexibility if ROI is clear?
- Who controls the budget?
- What would make this investment worthwhile?
</question_set>

<question_set name="timeline">
Time constraints:
- When do you need this completed?
- Are there any hard deadlines (events, seasons, compliance)?
- How much time can you dedicate to this project weekly?
- Who else needs to be involved and what are their availabilities?
</question_set>

<question_set name="risk-tolerance">
Change management considerations:
- How does your team typically react to new systems?
- Have previous technology changes caused disruption?
- What is your tolerance for a learning curve?
- Do you prefer proven solutions or are you open to newer approaches?
</question_set>

</constraint_mapping>

<problem_validation>

<technique name="five-whys">
Dig deeper to find root cause:
1. Why is this a problem? → Because X
2. Why does X happen? → Because Y
3. Why does Y happen? → Because Z
4. Why does Z happen? → Because W
5. Why does W happen? → Root cause identified
</technique>

<technique name="impact-quantification">
Understand the cost of the problem:
- How much time is spent on this issue weekly?
- How many customers are affected?
- What revenue is lost or at risk?
- What is the opportunity cost?
- How does this compare to solution cost?
</technique>

<technique name="success-criteria">
Define measurable outcomes:
- What metric would improve if we solve this?
- What number would make this a success?
- How will we measure progress?
- What is the minimum viable improvement?
</technique>

</problem_validation>

<red_flags>

<red_flag name="scope-creep-risk">
Watch for: "While we're at it, could you also..."
Response: Document scope clearly, defer additions to future phases
</red_flag>

<red_flag name="unclear-decision-maker">
Watch for: Vague answers about who approves
Response: Identify the actual decision maker and their criteria
</red_flag>

<red_flag name="unrealistic-expectations">
Watch for: "This should be easy/quick/cheap"
Response: Educate on actual effort required, set clear expectations
</red_flag>

<red_flag name="previous-failures">
Watch for: Multiple failed technology projects
Response: Understand what went wrong, address root causes
</red_flag>

<red_flag name="no-budget-discussion">
Watch for: Avoidance of budget questions
Response: Establish budget range early to avoid wasted effort
</red_flag>

</red_flags>

<discovery_output>

<deliverable name="context-summary">
After discovery, document:
- Business overview (who they are, what they do)
- Current state (systems, processes, pain points)
- Desired state (goals, success criteria)
- Constraints (budget, timeline, risk tolerance)
- Key stakeholders and decision process
- Recommended approach and rationale
</deliverable>
