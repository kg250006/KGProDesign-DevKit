<guidance>

<tip name="goals">Set SMART goals: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound. "Grow the business" is not a goal. "$50K in revenue from email marketing by March 31" is a goal.</tip>

<tip name="focus">Don't try to do everything. It's better to execute 2-3 channels well than 6 channels poorly. Add complexity only after proving fundamentals work.</tip>

<tip name="timeline">Be realistic about what you can accomplish. Marketing takes time to show results. Most campaigns need 90 days before you can evaluate success.</tip>

<tip name="flexibility">This is a living document. Review and adjust monthly. What you learn in month 1 should inform month 2.</tip>
