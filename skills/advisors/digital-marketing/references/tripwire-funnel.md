<overview>
Tripwire funnel for converting leads to buyers with a low-cost offer, then ascending to higher-value products.
</overview>

<concept>

<definition>
A tripwire is a low-priced, high-value offer (typically $7-47) designed to convert leads into paying customers quickly. The goal is not profit on the tripwire, but to offset acquisition costs and create buyers who are more likely to purchase higher-priced offers.
</definition>

<psychology>
- First purchase is hardest decision
- Buyers have higher trust than leads
- Small commitment leads to larger commitment
- Recoup ad spend quickly for faster scaling
