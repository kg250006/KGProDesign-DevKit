<key_terms>

<term name="pre-money-valuation">
Definition: Company value before new investment
Calculation: Pre-money = Post-money - Investment Amount
Example: $10M post-money - $2M investment = $8M pre-money
Impact: Higher pre-money = less dilution for founders
</term>

<term name="post-money-valuation">
Definition: Company value after new investment
Calculation: Post-money = Pre-money + Investment Amount
Ownership: Investment / Post-money = Investor ownership %
Post-money SAFEs: Valuation cap IS the post-money value
</term>

<term name="liquidation-preference">
Definition: Order and amount of payment in liquidity event
Types:
- Non-participating: Gets preference OR conversion (greater of)
- Participating: Gets preference AND pro-rata share

</term>

<term name="anti-dilution">
Definition: Protection against down rounds
Types:
- Full ratchet: Converts as if invested at new lower price
- Broad-based weighted average: Adjusts based on dilutive impact
