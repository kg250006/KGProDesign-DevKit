Key Decisions:
- IP ownership (Section 4.3): Choose client-owns or provider-licenses based on business model
- Liability cap: Typically 12 months of fees, adjust based on risk
- Indemnification: Consider mutual indemnification for equal bargaining power
- Dispute resolution: Arbitration is faster/private; litigation may be preferred for enforceability
- Automatic renewal: Include if long-term relationships expected

Industry-Specific Considerations:
- SaaS: Add data protection terms, SLAs
- Consulting: Strengthen non-compete/non-solicitation
- Creative: Detailed IP assignment, moral rights waiver
- Technical: Acceptance testing, warranty periods
