Key Decisions:

Management Structure:
- Member-managed: All members run the business (simpler, good for small groups)
- Manager-managed: Designated manager(s) run the business (better for investor members)

Voting Thresholds:
- Majority: Easier decisions but less protection for minorities
- Supermajority (66-75%): Balance of efficiency and protection
- Unanimous: Maximum protection but risk of deadlock

Transfer Restrictions:
- Tighter restrictions protect remaining members
- Consider drag-along and tag-along rights for larger groups
- Right of first refusal is standard

Distribution Policy:
- Pro-rata based on ownership is simplest
- Special allocations require careful tax structuring
- Tax distributions protect members from phantom income

State-Specific Considerations:
- Delaware: Very flexible, default rules favor members
- California: Specific operating agreement requirements, franchise tax
- New York: Publication requirement

Additional Provisions to Consider:
- Buy-sell provisions (for member death/disability)
- Deadlock resolution
- Drag-along and tag-along rights
- Anti-dilution provisions
