<customization_notes>
For Founder Assignments:
- Use at company formation or when IP is contributed
- Ensure adequate consideration (stock or payment)
- Complete Exhibits A and B thoroughly
- Get separate assignment if significant IP is contributed later

For Contractor Assignments:
- Include in every contractor agreement
- Standard "work for hire" alone is NOT sufficient for many works
- Require explicit assignment language
- Address pre-existing materials carefully

State-Specific Considerations:
- California Labor Code 2870: Inventions made on own time, not using employer resources, may be excluded
- Some states have similar protections
- Include appropriate carve-outs if in these states

Red Flags:
- Contractor unwilling to sign assignment
- Pre-existing materials not clearly identified
- No consideration for assignment
- Vague description of assigned IP
- Missing signature from all contributors
