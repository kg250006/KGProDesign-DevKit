<step_1 name="ip-audit">
Identify intellectual property assets:

<ip_categories>
Trademarks:
- Business name
- Product/service names
- Logos and designs
- Slogans and taglines
- Domain names

Copyrights:
- Software code
- Website content
- Marketing materials
- Documentation
- Original designs
- Photos and videos

Patents:
- Inventions and processes
- Novel technical solutions
- Unique methods
- Hardware designs

Trade Secrets:
- Proprietary algorithms
- Customer lists
- Pricing strategies
- Manufacturing processes
- Business methods
- Formulas and recipes
</ip_categories>

For each asset, document:
- Description of the asset
- When it was created
- Who created it (employee, contractor, founder)
- Current protection status
- Business value/importance
</step_1>

<step_2 name="protection-strategy">
Develop protection approach for each asset type:

<trademark_strategy>
Assessment questions:
- Is the mark distinctive? (fanciful > arbitrary > suggestive > descriptive)
- What are the goods/services?
- Where do you need protection? (US, international)
- Any conflicting marks?

Protection steps:
1. Conduct comprehensive trademark search
2. Clear with trademark attorney
3. File federal trademark application
4. Monitor for infringement
5. Enforce rights consistently

Timeline: 8-12 months for registration
Cost estimate: $225-400 per class (filing) + attorney fees
</trademark_strategy>

<copyright_strategy>
Key principle: Copyright exists automatically upon creation

Protection steps:
1. Document creation dates
2. Include copyright notices
3. Consider federal registration for valuable works
4. Ensure proper ownership (work for hire, assignments)

Benefits of registration:
- Statutory damages available
- Attorney fees recoverable
- Prima facie evidence of ownership

Cost estimate: $45-65 per work (filing)
</copyright_strategy>

<patent_strategy>
Assessment questions:
- Is the invention novel and non-obvious?
- Has it been publicly disclosed?
- What is the commercial value?
- Is patent protection worth the cost?

Protection paths:
- Provisional patent: 12 months protection, lower cost
- Utility patent: Full protection, 20 years
- Design patent: Ornamental aspects, 15 years

Decision factors:
- Cost ($5,000-15,000+ for utility)
- Time to commercialize
- Competitive landscape
- Enforcement resources

Alternative: Trade secret protection (for some innovations)
</patent_strategy>

<trade_secret_strategy>
Protection requirements:
- Information has economic value from being secret
- Reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy

Protection steps:
1. Identify what qualifies as trade secrets
2. Implement confidentiality measures
3. Use NDAs with employees and partners
4. Limit access on need-to-know basis
5. Mark confidential materials appropriately
6. Exit procedures for departing employees

No registration required, but must actively protect
</trade_secret_strategy>
</step_2>

<step_3 name="documentation">
Generate appropriate protection documents:

<documents>
IP Assignment Agreement:
- For contractors and employees
- Ensure ownership of work product
- Cover background vs foreground IP

Invention Disclosure Form:
- Document inventions before filing
- Establish creation dates
- Identify inventors

Trademark Usage Guidelines:
- Proper use of marks
- Approved versions
- Protection of brand

Confidentiality Agreements:
- For employees, contractors, partners
- Define confidential information
- Set obligations and term
</documents>
</step_3>

<step_4 name="ongoing-protection">
Establish ongoing IP management:

<maintenance>
Trademark maintenance:
- Section 8/9 filings (5-6 years, then 9-10 years)
- Monitor for infringement
- Police unauthorized use

Copyright management:
- Track all registered works
- Maintain creation records
- Monitor for infringement

Patent maintenance:
- Pay maintenance fees (3.5, 7.5, 11.5 years)
- Monitor competitive landscape
- Consider licensing opportunities

Trade secret management:
- Regular audits
- Update security measures
- Enforce agreements
</maintenance>
</step_4>

</process>

<priority_framework>

<high_priority>
- Brand/trademark protection (core business identity)
- Trade secrets that provide competitive advantage
- IP ownership clarity (prevent future disputes)
</high_priority>

<medium_priority>
- Copyright registration for valuable works
- Patent filing for key innovations
- Employee IP agreements
</medium_priority>

<lower_priority>
- Comprehensive registration of all copyrights
- Design patents for aesthetic elements
- International filing (until business expands)
</lower_priority>
