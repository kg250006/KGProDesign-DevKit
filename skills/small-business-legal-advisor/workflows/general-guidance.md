<step_1 name="understand">
Parse and categorize the question:

<legal_areas>
Contracts: Agreements, terms, negotiations
IP: Trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets
Corporate: Formation, governance, compliance
Employment: Hiring, firing, policies, classification
Privacy/Data: GDPR, CCPA, data protection
Regulatory: Industry-specific compliance
Tax: Structure, planning, obligations
Disputes: Conflicts, claims, resolution
</legal_areas>

Assess question characteristics:
- Urgency level (immediate, near-term, planning)
- Complexity (simple question, multi-faceted issue)
- Business impact (low, medium, high stakes)
- Context needed (standalone vs requires background)

Determine if question is:
- Within scope: General legal guidance for small business
- Boundary case: May require professional referral
- Out of scope: Specific legal advice, active litigation

- Explain why context matters

Industry-specific considerations:
- Regulations that apply
- Common practices in their industry
- Typical risk areas
</step_2>
