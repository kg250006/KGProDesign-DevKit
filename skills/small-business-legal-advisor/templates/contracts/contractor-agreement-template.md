<customization_notes>
Classification Safeguards:
- Section 4 establishes independent contractor status
- Key factors: control over method, other clients permitted, no benefits
- Still need to behave consistently with these terms

IP Assignment:
- Section 5 is critical - ensures you own all work
- Work-for-hire alone is insufficient for contractors
- Get explicit assignment AND work-for-hire language
- Pre-existing materials carve-out protects contractor's prior work

For Specific Industries:
- Software: Add open source compliance clause
- Design: Add specific moral rights waiver, file format requirements
- Writing: Add publication rights, byline policies
- Consulting: Strengthen non-compete, non-solicitation

Red Flags to Avoid:
- Don't require specific working hours
- Don't provide equipment (they should have their own)
- Don't include in company meetings, org charts
- Don't provide training beyond project-specific orientation
