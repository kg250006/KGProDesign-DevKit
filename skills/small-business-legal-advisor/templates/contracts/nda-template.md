When to Use:
- Mutual NDA: When both parties will share confidential information
- One-Way NDA: When only your company is disclosing information

Key Customization Points:
- Purpose: Be specific enough to limit use but broad enough for flexibility
- Term: 2 years is standard; shorter for sensitive discussions
- Survival: 3-5 years typical; trade secrets should survive indefinitely
- Governing Law: Usually your home state

Common Modifications:
- Add non-solicitation of employees
- Add specific categories of confidential information
- Carve out specific permitted disclosures (e.g., to attorneys, accountants)
- Add residual knowledge clause (for sophisticated counterparties)
